# owf-project-south-platte-data-platform #

This repository contains the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org/) project website content for
the South Platte Data Platform, which is a project funded by the
[Colorado Water Conservation Board](http://cwcb.state.co.us) through its Water Supply Reserve Fund grant program.
The project website is being maintained in version control on GitHub and uses MkDocs in order to streamline deployment of the
website to coordinate the project and provide access to preliminary products prior to deployment
to a system integrated with South Platte/Metro Roundtable.

See the deployed website [OWF / Projects](http://projects.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-proj-south-platte-data-platform/).
