# South Platte Data Platform / Project Coordination #

The South Platte Data Platform project is fundamentally a project to benefit the South Platte and Metro Roundtables.
The results of the project will help the Roundtable members and their stakeholders
better understand water resources issues in the South Platte Basin, as well as educating the public.
The Open Water Foundation's efforts on the project will benefit from the insight of a Roundtable committee.
This page of the documentation provides information to facilitate coordination of this effort.

## Project Scope and Schedule ##

**TODO smalers 2017-10-29 need to summarize scope and schedule - transfer from proposal**

Initial project focus is:

* Create project website for coordination (this website)
* Publish initial foundational datasets and visualizations such as municipalities and water providers
* Publish Identified Projects and Processes (IPPs) list and map
* Determine/prototype technologies and process to publish/host data and visualizations, such as CWCB map viewer,
Colorado Information Marketplace, South Platte Basin website, State Google Cloud Platform, OWF website, etc.

## South Platte Data Platform Roundtable Committee ##

The results of the South Platte Data Platform will be made available to the full South Platte and Metro Roundtables and the public.
There will be opportunities for the full Roundtables to interact with the OWF project team.
However, a committee has been created to streamline coordination and provide feedback to OWF.
The following are members of the committee and primary subject matter areas of interest, based on professional duties and Roundtable role:

## Coordination with SWSI Update ##

The Open Water Foundation is part of the consultant team performing the
[SWSI Update Project](http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSIUpdate.aspx) for the CWCB
and is also involved with other CWCB projects.
Consequently, OWF will leverage the work done in the SWSI Update with the South Platte Data Platform and
coordinate the results of the South Platte Data Platform with the SWSI Update.
The goal is to provide access to useful data and visualizations in a way that benefits the Roundtables and SWSI Update effort.
Specific coordination efforts include:

1. Identified Projects and Processes (IPPs) - "consumptive" IPPs
	1. OWF has provided recommendations to the CWCB to standardize IPP data so that it can be used
	in common products such as maps and project lists (tables).
	2. OWF is working on processes and tools to automate creating basin and statewide maps and project lists from
	the IPP data.
2. StateMod/SWSI Modeling Tools
	1. OWF is working with Wilson Water Group to integrate StateMod model datasets with
	visualizations
3. Data Dissemination
	1. OWF is working with Brown and Caldwell on data dissemination tasks for SWSI data

## Coordination with Roundtable Education and Outreach ##

OWF is coordinating the South Platte Data Platform Project with the South Platte and Metro education and outreach efforts
so that project results can be used for education.
Most of this effort is being driven by the Education and Outreach group,
with evaluation of opportunities provided by this project, such as adding information to [southplattebasin.com website](http://southplattebasin.com).

## Coordination with Roundtable Environment and Recreation Subcommittee ##

The South Platte Data Platform project is attempting to coordinate with the E&R Subcommittee.
The E&R Subcommittee does not meet very often.
This project provides an opportunity to advance their interests.

* A video call was hosted at Northern Water on Feb 6, 2018
	+ Darren Beck, David Nickum [phone], Jim Hall, Joe Frank [phone], Lacey Williams, Lynda James [phone], Pete Conovitz, Steve Malers
	+ Steve demonstrated a number of efforts that the Open Water Foundation is working on including:
		- using Source Water Route Framework as a basis for stream linework
		- developing open and accessible datasets to provide context,
		such as municipalities, municipal water providers, ditch companies, rafting companies
		- basin visualization tools such as for snowpack
		- river health visualization tools
	+ Point was made that SWSI/BIPS produced a lot of E&R data but is it accessible online (generally not)
	and at the right resolution (for example CWP data is at HUC scale)
	+ Point was made that there is no central repository for information - datasets are spread throughout
	agencies and are siloed
	+ Could develop an incubator for projects
	+ South Platte has not tapped into the SMP process (although some smaller basins in the South Platte have)
	+ Diversion dams could be a good dataset
	+ Master plan extent overlaid on streams could be a good dataset
	+ Much data is not in a format useful for mapping (hard-copies, spreadsheets, etc.)
	+ [parkcountytrust.org](http://www.parkcountytrust.org/) has a map of projects online
	(used to publish as PDF but new applications  must provide coordinates)
	+ It is easy to get overwhelmed with data and information - need to figure out simple stories to tell
	+ Could use Outdoor Retail Conference in July as a touch point - SP/Metro BRT will have a table.
	+ Can highlight Lower South Platte Conservancy District work, such as Visual South Platte
	+ Point was made to bring nature to people
		- Create opportunities close to home
		- Chatfield
		- Fort Collins
		- Northern/NISP/Baseflow options
		- Working/healthy river
	+ SMP involving Denver Water supply, Coalition for Upper South Platte, could be highlighted
	+ Ducks Unlimited recharge story could be told
	+ CDOT water quality issues (sand vs. salt) is a specific example

## Coordination with Other Projects ##

OWF is working on several other projects that may intersect with the South Platte Data Platform Project.

1. [Colorado Basin Roundtable Integrated Water Management Planning Framework](http://www.coloradomesa.edu/water-center/colorado-basin-roundtable-integrated-water-management-planning-framework-project.html)
coordinated through Colorado Mesa University
	* Includes all water uses
2. OpenCDSS - moving CDSS software tools to open source
	* Increased transparency and collaboration on complex water issues and tools
3. [OWF GeoProcessor](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-app-geoprocessor-python-doc-user/)
	* Open source software to automate geospatial data processing
	* Goal is to demonstrate examples of processing workflows so that automation can be used
	to scale up data processing to support analysis and visualization
