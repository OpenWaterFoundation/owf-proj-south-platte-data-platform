# South Platte Data Platform / Project Coordination #

The South Platte Data Platform project is fundamentally a project to benefit the South Platte and Metro Roundtables.
The results of the project will help the Roundtable members and their stakeholders
better understand water resources issues in the South Platte Basin, as well as educating the public.
The Open Water Foundation's efforts on the project will benefit from the insight of a Roundtable committee.
This page of the documentation provides information to facilitate coordination of this effort.

## Project Scope and Schedule ##

**TODO smalers 2017-10-29 need to summarize scope and schedule - transfer from proposal**

Initial project focus is:

* Create project website for coordination (this website)
* Publish initial foundational datasets and visualizations such as municipalities and water providers
* Publish Identified Projects and Processes (IPPs) list and map
* Determine/prototype technologies and process to publish/host data and visualizations, such as CWCB map viewer,
Colorado Information Marketplace, South Platte Basin website, State Google Cloud Platform, OWF website, etc.

## South Platte Data Platform Roundtable Committee ##

The results of the South Platte Data Platform will be made available to the full South Platte and Metro Roundtables and the public.
There will be opportunities for the full Roundtables to interact with the OWF project team.
However, a committee has been created to streamline coordination and provide feedback to OWF.
The following are members of the committee and primary subject matter areas of interest, based on professional duties and Roundtable role:

Additional coordination information will be provided here as the project moves forward.

## Coordination with SWSI Update ##

The Open Water Foundation is part of the consultant team performing the
[SWSI Update Project](http://cwcb.state.co.us/water-management/water-supply-planning/Pages/SWSIUpdate.aspx) for the CWCB
and is also involved with other CWCB projects.
Consequently, OWF will leverage the work done in the SWSI Update with the South Platte Data Platform and
coordinate the results of the South Platte Data Platform with the SWSI Update.
The goal is to provide access to useful data and visualizations in a way that benefits the Roundtables and SWSI Update effort.

## Coordination with Roundtable Education and Outreach ##

OWF is coordinating the South Platte Data Platform Project with the South Platte and Metro education and outreach efforts
so that project results can be used for education.
