# South Platte Data Platform / Visualizations #

South Platte Data Platform visualizations are based on datasets created in the South Platte Data Platform project and datasets from other sources.
The datasets are joined and processed into formats needed by visualization tools.
The data and visualizations are published on the web to provide public access.

The project will leverage Open Water Foundation work from other projects and add new visualizations.
For example, see visualizations at the Open Water Foundation:

**More information will be added as the project progresses.**
