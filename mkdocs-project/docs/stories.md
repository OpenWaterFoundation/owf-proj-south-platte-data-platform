# South Platte Data Platform / Stories #

Stories within the South Platte Data Platform consist of multiple datasets and visualizations integrated in a way
that provides context and perspective, in order to educate and illustrate about water resource issues.
Stories are intended to integrate data and science with human connection in order to achieve greater understanding and dialogue.

**Stories will be added as the project progresses.**
